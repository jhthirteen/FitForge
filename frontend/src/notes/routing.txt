Routing - the act of redirecting users to different pages based on their actions and requests
In React, we use the react-router-dom library to handle this 

Folder structure: 
src/pages contains different components that we can route to 

Routing is setup and handled in our /src/main.jsx (which is our entry point for Vite)
Because this is a Vite project - everything is injected into index.html
So, in main.jsx, wrap the main <App/> component in <BrowserRouter> components to enable routing 
- this gives your React app access to the curent URL path 
Define the routes themselves within App.jsx
